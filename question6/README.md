## Question 6

(Eckel, 7.1) Create a Text class that contains a string object to hold the text of a file. Give it two constructors: a default constructor and a constructor that takes a string argument that is the name of thefile to open. When the second constructor is used, open the file and read the contents into the string member object. Add a member function contents() to return the string so (for example) it can be printed. In main(), open a file using Text and print the contents.  

Note that you will have to research on your own how to open files in C++.
